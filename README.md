About the Application
This application was built for accessing an online boutique owned by a small family business. Customers can explore various designs and directly message the owner to inquire about stock availability and other queries. The content management system for this boutique is powered by Sanity, where the owner can add, edit details, and access messages sent by customers.

Feel free to contribute to the project and enhance the online boutique experience! For any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy exploring!
